            <h2>Project Synopsis</h2>
            <p>The goal for this project was to create a fictional business along with a mobile model prototype within Figma. The main purpose of this project was to demonstrate my UI/UX processes and principles, as well as working with Figma. When we were introduced to this project, we had found out that we had to divide the development of this project into two phases.</p>

            <h2>Lo-Fidelity Wireframes (Phase 1)</h2>
            <p>In the early stages of this project, I wanted to create a business that revolves around jewelry, since I enjoy wearing jewelry and have shopped on many jewelry sites. So I took upon brainstorming ideas for the brand’s identity (brand name, logo, color scheme), as well as the user’s interactive process.</p> 
            <p>For this project, I wanted to call this business "JJewelry" and I mainly wanted to site to consist of green tones. I decided that I had wanted the user to take on the ideal checkout process, so I came up with some lofi-wireframes.</p>

            <h2>Hi-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
            <p>Upon completing the Lo-Fidelity wireframes, it was time to work on the Hi-Fidelity wireframes which meant creating a component page for different buttons, checkboxes, icons, applying proper fonts, color schemes, and the implementation of the final logo in order to capture the brand's identity.</p>

            <h2>User-Testing (Phase 2)</h2>
            <p>Phase 2 was all about conducting user testing and finding out whether or not our prototypes functioned properly. User testing groups were then formed within our cohort and then we imported our Figma prototypes into the user testing software, Maze. The testing process took over a week, as each group had a set of 6 testers. We then had to review our results and put everything into a report, covering the failure or success rates within our test.</p>

        <div class="hifi">
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Overall, I thought my test was successful since user effectiveness and satisfaction metrics ended up only resulting in success cases. Fortunately enough, my tasks did not have any bounce rates, but did undergo both direct and indirect success cases.</p>
