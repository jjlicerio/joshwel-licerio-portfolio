            <h2>Project Synopsis</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project was to create a fictional business, and to identify user processes and flows through building out user personas, scenarios and a flowchart in order to help develop a mobile model prototype within Adobe XD.</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In the early stages of this project, I decided that I wanted my fictional business to revolve around selling ceramics and pottery â€“ So I came up with CeramicSpot which is an online website for people who enjoy ceramics. I wanted the website to feature articles and an eCommerce page, selling various pottery and ceramics.</p>

                <h2>User Persona</h2>
                <p>In terms of planning out this project, I first started with building out my user persona. My fictional persona involves Joyce Hemingwood, a ceramist is known for her Artist Residencies across Vancouver, as well as running her own blogspot where she shares her experience and knowledge with ceramics. She has previously instructed a ceramics course, and is currently working towards her MFA in ceramics at Emily Carr.</p>

            <h2>User Scenario</h2>
            <p>When coming up with a scenario, I wanted the story to capture the process of the user browsing the page, viewing an item, adding it to their cart, and going through the checkout process. It all starts with Joyce searching for a pottery website to showcase on her blog, and hears about CeramicSpot from a close friend, so she visits their website on her mobile device and sees what they have to offer. She then browses through the store, adds an item to her cart, and goes through the checkout process of filling out her shipping and payment methods/information.</p>
            <h2>User Flowchart</h2>
            <p>The flowchart that I developed for this projects shows the ideal user flow for the process of checking out an item. In the chart, the user will go through multiple screens requiring the user to input their information into a box in order to proceed to the order summary page and confirm their order.</p>
