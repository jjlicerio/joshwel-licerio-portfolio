                <p>A Graphic Design Project</p>

            <h2>Project Synopsis</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project was to demonstrate our design knowledge and skills with Adobe InDesign by re-branding and creating a menu of an existing restaurant. When we first were introduced to this project, we were assigned the task of picking a restaurant of our choice. So I decided to rebrand and create a menu for Charley’s Philly Steaks, one of my favourite sandwich spots.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="desc">
                <h2>Logo Creation</h2>
                <p>We first had to come up with some logo ideas for the restaraunt’s rebrand by generating six hand-drawn thumbnail variant sketches and pick one out of the six. I decided that I wanted this logo to look very playful and nostalgic, I also wanted it to really capture the “Charley’s Philly Steaks” brand. The final logo I ended up with consisted of rounded fonts, and natural shapes. I also wrapped the wordmark “Philly Steaks” around two loafs of bread, as if the wordmark was inside of the sandwich.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="lofi">
            <h2>Menu Page Creation</h2>
            <p>Our next steps were to create hand-drawn thumbnail sketches for each menu page. We had to rely on the principles of design, which meant working around hierarchy, proximity, repetition, alignment. We had to create 2-3 sketches for each page (maximum of 3 pages). I wanted this layout to look attractive, while still maintaining it’s playfulness, so I kept the design consistent with the rounded-look. The first page was for the sandwiches and toppings, the second page was for the chicken wings,the third page was for the side items and drinks.</p>

        <div class="hifi">
            <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
            <p>In terms of the color scheme of this rebrand, I wanted to take on the approach of a triadic color-scheme consisting of the primary colors, with red being the dominant color, and yellow as the secondary. I chose those two colors because they are known to cause a biological reaction of increasing an appetite, which is fitting for the demographic. The main logo includes the three of these colors.</p>

        <div class="hifi">
            <h2>Creating the Pages</h2>
            <p>The next step was to bring our designs to the screen with InDesign. This meant digitally recreating all the thumbnails for the logos and menu pages. We also had to design the cover-page for the menu. I decided to make the cover-page for the menu have this blue checkerboard pattern, which brings the color scheme together as a whole. Ideally, I wanted it to look as if it were apart of a retro-diner.</p>

            <img class="zoom-img" src="images/charleys-page-1.jpg" alt="Page One">
            <img class="zoom-img" src="images/charleys-page-2.jpg" alt="Page Two">
            <img class="zoom-img" src="images/charleys-page-3.jpg" alt="Page Three">
        </div>
        <div class="hifi">
            <p>Putting all the elements within my menu together really made it feel like I was assembling a puzzle, trying to find out where certain elements go, as we still had to keep design principles in mind. I wanted to guide the eyes of the reader to flow naturally, I did this by creating an asymmetrical balance (One section floats left, the other section flows right) as well as creating a hierarchy within my content (Headers, side articles and menu items).</p>
