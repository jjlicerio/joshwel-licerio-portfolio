            <h2>Project Synopsis</h2>
            <p>The goal for this project was to demonstrate the use of a digital camera, as well as planning and organizing the photoshoot, gathering equipment, props and models. Practicing professionalism was an important aspect to this project, as we had to deal with live models and assistants.</p>

            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p>Upon starting this project, we first had to come up with an initial concept in order to plan a creative direction, as well as to come up with an idea of what the setting of the composite would be. For this project, I wanted my project to create the illusion of miniature scaled models surrounded by larger-scaled houseplants. I also wanted this to be a series of composites, instead of one single image. The Studio Ghibli film “The Secret World of Arrietty” is what initially inspired me when I first thought of this idea.</p>

                <h2>Initial Concept</h2>
                <p>In terms of planning out this project, I decided to draw out my concept in order to get a visual representation to see how I would go about planning out the production of these images. I then came up with three concept images, which really helped me define my vision as well as some of the necessary equipment and assistance I needed.</p>

            <h2>Photo Shoot</h2>
            <p>When it came to shooting out the actual photos, I found that this process was actually quite pleasing to me due to the environment I was in. I had everything planned out and all the necessary equipment, so everything went smoothly. My first step was to take photos of my plants to set the base for the photo and to get a general idea of how my model should be posing. I decided to use these three images for the series.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="lofi">
            <p>My next step was to capture my live model in poses that would fit for each image of the plants. I had some extra help on hand to help me pose my model and capture their mannerisms. One thing I had to keep in mind was to take extra photos to help capture the right angle to help create the illusion within the final composite.</p>

            <h2>Editing Process</h2>
            <p>Now that I have gathered all of my assets, it was time to take the photos I took into Photoshop post production and process each image, making sure each photo had the same lighting. Stitching the photos together was quite easy, and kind of reminded me of putting a scrapbook together. We had to demonstrate the use of the pen tool to cut out images precisely and sticking them onto other images and adding extra detail. In the end, I was able to achieve the following results:</p>
