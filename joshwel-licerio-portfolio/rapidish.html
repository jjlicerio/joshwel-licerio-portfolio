            <h2>Project Synopsis</h2>
            <p>The goal for this project was to work with the waterfall methodology within a team, and to create a fictional business to work around. The main purpose of this project was to simulate working  within a development team,  having to meet deadlines/standards with deliverables.</p>

                <h2>Sitemap, User Persona & Scenario</h2>
                <p>These three helped define the user process and flow of the model as we wanted the prototype to go through the ideal checkout process. The sitemap was created using diagrams.net. This sitemap outlined the mockup landing page for Rapidish and established what was going to be what was on the website’s main navigation, subheaders and footer.</p>
                <p>The fictional persona and scenario was created using Flowmapp. My fictional persona revolves around Senior Chef, Rick Andres who struggles to balance his flexibility with time between his two occupations, managing a kitchen and parenthood. 
                Rick struggles with putting dinner on the table for his family due to running his kitchen all the time. So he visits Rapidish and sets up a plan for him and his family.</p>

        <div class="lofi">
            <h2>Lo-Fidelty Wireframes</h2>
            <p>After creating the sitemap, persona and scenario my next task was to create some Lo-Fi wireframes for Rapidish’s mobile app model. Figma was used for constructing these wireframes, and were built in black and white. These were also built with the help of the persona/scenario to create the flow of the app. Some references and inspiration I looked towards came from Hello Fresh and Chef’s Plate for creating the interface for this app.</p>
            <p>After the completion of these wireframes, I then wanted to review with my group to see if they had any feedback or revisions they would want to apply. Some of the revisions my team and I had made was to split the checkout process into more pages to help with easing, adding back buttons to go to previous pages, and moving around elements at the top of the page to allow space for the phones notch.</p>

        <div class="hifi">
            <h2>Hi-Fidelty Wireframes</h2>
            <p>Upon completing the lo-fi wireframes with its revisions, it was time to work on the Hi-Fi wireframeswhich meant referencing styles from the designer’s style guide to really capture the brand’s identity. This goes for applying fonts, colors, and logos.</p>
